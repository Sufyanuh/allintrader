              APPLICATION OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND FORMATION OF
              CONTRACT
            </h5>
            <ol>
              <li>
                These terms and conditions apply and form part of the Contract
                between All In Traders and the Customer. They supersede any
                previously issued terms and conditions.
              </li>
              <li>
                No terms or conditions endorsed on, delivered with, or contained
                in the Customer's purchase order, Customer’s confirmation of
                order or Customer’s specification will form part of the
                Contract.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each Order by the Customer to All In Traders will be deemed to
                be an offer to purchase Goods and/or Services subject to the
                Conditions. No Order which has been accepted by All In Traders
                may be cancelled by the Customer except with the written
                agreement of All In Traders.
              </li>
              <li>
                An Order will be accepted by All In Traders only when it
                confirms so to the Customer at its sole discretion. All In
                Traders reserves the right at all times to reject any Order, in
                whole or in part, at its sole discretion. If All In Traders
                accepts an Order by confirming the same to the Customer then
                there will be a binding agreement in place between All In
                Traders and the Customer for the supply of the relevant Goods
                and/or Services to the Customer.
              </li>
              <li>
                No variation of these Conditions or to an Order, or to an
                estimate from All In Traders will be binding unless expressly
                confirmed in writing by a duly authorised signatory on behalf of
                All In Traders. If the Customer wishes to make a variation to
                the Goods to be supplied after acceptance of an Order by All In
                Traders then it may make a request to All In Traders in writing
                and All In Traders will thereafter:
                <ul>
                  <li>confirm whether it will accept such variation; and</li>
                  <li>
                    provide an estimate of costs that will be incurred by such
                    variation.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                If All In Traders will accept such variation then the Customer
                will be liable to pay such additional costs of All In Traders as
                it shall notify to the Customer.
              </li>
              <li>
                All In Traders may supply estimates for the supply of Goods
                and/or Services. In the event that an estimate is given by All
                In Traders it will be deemed to be an invitation to treat (and
                shall not be an offer) by All In Traders to supply Goods and/or
                Services on and subject to the Conditions. Any estimate by All
                In Traders for the supply of Goods and/or Services will be valid
                for 1 month from the date of issue.
              </li>
              <li>
                All In Traders’s employees or agents are not authorised to make
                any representations concerning the Goods or Services unless such
                representations are confirmed by All In Traders in writing to
                the Customer. In entering into the Contract the Customer
                acknowledges that it does not rely on any such representations
                which are not confirmed by All In Traders in writing but nothing
                in these Conditions affects either party’s liability for
                fraudulent misrepresentation.

          <p>
            <h5>PRICE</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The price, as outlined in the estimate provided by All in
                Trader, is subject to clause 4.2. Unless stated otherwise, this
                price excludes VAT, which will be charged by All in Trader at
                the applicable rate, to be paid by the customer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Estimates provided by All in Trader are not binding, and
                additional charges may apply beyond those outlined. This could
                arise if:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The customer requests additional or different
                    goods/services, to which All in Trader agrees.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    All in Trader deems it necessary to adjust goods/services to
                    comply with health, safety, or statutory requirements, upon
                    agreement with the customer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    All in Trader identifies a need for changes due to incorrect
                    or misleading information provided by the customer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The quantity or type of goods/services required differs from
                    what was initially communicated in the estimate.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Changes occur in delivery location, equipment, or premises
                    affecting service provision.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Service provision is disrupted, not due to All in Trader's
                    fault.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                All in Trader will notify the customer of any additional costs
                and seek approval before proceeding unless it's unsafe or
                impossible to delay, in which case All in Trader will proceed
                with the service.
              </li>
              <li>
                Unless otherwise agreed in writing or through a pre-approved
                credit facility, payment of the full price by the customer to
                All in Trader must be made in cleared funds 48 hours before
                delivery, with payment timing being crucial.
              </li>
              <li>
                Failure to pay the price by the due date will incur interest at
                a rate of eight (8) per cent per annum above the base rate of
                Barclays Bank plc, in accordance with the Late Payment of
                Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998.
              </li>
              <li>
                All in Trader reserves the right, without prejudice to other
                rights, to suspend or cancel goods/services if sums due are not
                paid in full by the due date, and to terminate contracts with
                the customer upon written notice.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the delivery location is inaccessible or unfit for delivery
                at the estimated date, or if items have not been fully paid for
                as per clause 4.3, All in Trader may charge the customer £100.00
                as a cancellation fee for the order.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5>DELIVERY</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The goods will be delivered to the designated delivery location,
                and services will be provided at the same location.
              </li>
              <li>
                Goods will be considered delivered upon their arrival at the
                delivery location, while services will be deemed complete upon
                arrival and unloading at the delivery location.
              </li>
              <li>
                All in Trader will make reasonable efforts to meet estimated
                delivery dates and times, but these are approximate, and timely
                delivery is not essential.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the customer needs to change a delivery date or time for
                goods, they must notify All in Trader at least 48 hours before
                the estimated delivery date and time.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the delivery location is inaccessible or unfit for goods
                delivery at the estimated date, All in Trader reserves the right
                to charge the customer for the goods' price and any associated
                delivery costs as a cancellation fee.
              </li>
              <li>
                All in Trader will not be responsible for delays or failures in
                delivery of goods or services due to:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Customer's failure to make the delivery location available.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Customer's failure to prepare the delivery location as
                    instructed by All in Trader or as required for service
                    provision.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Customer's failure to provide adequate instructions for
                    delivery or service.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Any delay or failure by a third party in supplying goods or
                    services to the customer.
                  </li>
                  <li>An event of force majeure.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                If, 10 business days after the due date for delivery or
                collection of goods, the customer has not taken delivery, All in
                Trader may resell or dispose of the goods. In such cases:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    All in Trader will invoice the customer for reasonable

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    All in Trader will either account to the customer for any
                    excess of the resale price over the original price paid
                    (provided the customer has paid in full), or invoice the
                    customer for any shortfall of the resale price below the
                    original price paid.
